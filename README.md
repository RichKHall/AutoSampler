# AutoSampler
AutoSampler Simulator

Purpose: To Emulate AutoSampler HW/SW system

Physical Control Components [and discrete representative states]:
- Gripper [opened, closed]
- Gripper Extender [Sampler, Carousel, Riser Space, Warmer]
- Gripper Escalator [Top, Above Tubes, Mid Tube, Sampler]

Physical Detection Components [and functional outputs]
- Tube Detector Check [Present, Empty]

Architectural Design: FSM Event Driven

Trial Emulation #1: Parameters for programming platform or language
- Simple creation and use of FSM, Event driven for each object
- Simple to connect objections (logically and physically) meaningfully
- Simple to create visualization of objects and actions
- Simple for providing means of collision detection (& inserting exceptional circumstances)
Best Candidates:
- "processing" (visual coding)
- HTML5 + javascript
- python & visual designer toolkit
- C# &/or canvas
- C/C++ and doskey graphics
