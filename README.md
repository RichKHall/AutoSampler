# AutoSampler
AutoSampler Simulator

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Purpose: To Emulate AutoSampler HW/SW system

Physical Control Components [and discrete representative states]:
- Gripper [opened, closed]
- Gripper Extender [Sampler, Carousel, Riser Space, Warmer]
- Gripper Escalator [Top, Above Tubes, Mid Tube, Sampler]

Physical Detection Components [and functional outputs]
- Tube Detector Check [Present, Empty]

Trial Emulation #1: use of the "processing" (visual coding) language
Architectural Design: FSM Event Driven
